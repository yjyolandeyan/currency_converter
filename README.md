7. Then, go on any page you are interested in, say Amazon. Click on the Currency Extension logo from the chrome extensions bar, and enter the "from currency" and "to currency" you are interested in. Both lowercase and uppercase are fine. Then, click "Submit", and the conversion ratio will occur below "Submit" so does the range of prices on the given page.

## Notes 

Since many variations of this Chrome extension already exist, it may be challenging to distinguish our product from others. Since this is a relatively simple product, I think that a potentially unique approach for us could be to make the UI especially compelling and user friendly. We are considering an option where the conversion happens automatically when one highlights a number on the webpage. An even further step would be to do an automatic conversion, the way certain translation Chrome extensions work.

## References & Inspiration 

We were inspired by the Currency Converter Widget Chrome extension which already exists, as a guideline of the general features which we want to include for our own Chrome extension. While we are not aiming to replicate this fully, we want to make sure we include the features that already exist in this extension and build upon them for our own project. The extension can be found here: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/currency-converter-widget/bnpalipgomknhgbmgelaplknnmckljaf

This extension will also be used to guide our UI improvements, since we will identify pain points in existing extensions and use them to improve our own extension. 

## Technical Details

### User Interface 

When users interact with the extension, they will typically see an icon in the Chrome toolbar, representing the currency converter. Upon clicking the icon, a small pop-up window will appear. This window will include:
- Input fields for the source currency amount and the selection of the source currency.
- Dropdown menus or search bars for selecting the target currency.
- Real-time conversion results displayed prominently, showing the converted amount.
- Additional settings or preferences accessible through a gear icon, allowing users to customize the extension behavior (such as language preferences, decimal precision, etc.).
- Buttons or shortcuts for quick actions, such as swapping source and target currencies, clearing input fields, accessing historical exchange rate data, and a bookmark for previous conversions saved by the user.
  
Users will interact with the extension primarily by inputting the source currency amount and selecting the source and target currencies using dropdown menus or search bars. The conversion results will be updated dynamically as users make changes, providing instant conversions. Additionally, users can customize their experience by adjusting settings or toggling between dark and light mode themes to suit their preferences.

### API, Libraries, and Frameworks

For this Chrome Extension, we plan to use the Google Finance API to obtain currency ratios on specific dates.

Google Finance API: Documentation, Yahoo Finance API

Explanation: We will use the Google Finance or Yahoo Finance API to fetch historical currency exchange rates for the desired date, enabling users to access accurate and reliable conversion rates within the extension.

### Data Storage 

We may need to store the last used currencies involved in conversion for ease of the user, especially if they tend to use just a few of the currency options and do not need to scroll through the full dropdown menu. Additionally, it may be useful to store past transactions and conversions, in case a user wants to view the last value they obtained. We may be able to use a simple relational database to store this data in the backend.

### Risks and Mitigation 

Risks:
- There may be technical challenges in implementing certain features or integrating with external APIs for currency data.
- The extension relies on third-party libraries or APIs, which could be subject to changes.

Mitigation:
- Break down complex features into smaller tasks and allocate sufficient time for troubleshooting and debugging.
- Utilize documentation and seek assistance from TAs and our instructor.
- Choose reliable and well-supported libraries or APIs with clear documentation and a history of stability.
- Have backup/ alternative libraries in place.
  
If things don't go as expected, the contingency plan may involve:
- Prioritizing the main features and functionalities to ensure that the core functionality of the extension is implemented on time.
- Considering alternative approaches or simplifications to meet the project deadline while maintaining the core value proposition of the extension.
