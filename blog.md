# Introducing Our Chrome Extension: Currency Converter

In our recent software engineering class, we embarked on an exciting team project to develop a Chrome extension that addresses a common problem faced by many users: converting currencies while browsing the internet. We proudly present our Currency Converter extension, designed to provide real-time conversion rates with just a click of a button. Hereâ€™s a detailed overview of our project, including how to install and use it, and the problem it solves.

## Meet the Team
The Currency Converter extension is a collaborative effort by:
- **Tianyi Wu**
- **Yola Yan**
- **Ruth Tilahun**
- **Akanksha Tripathy**

## Why Did We Create This Extension?
The goal of our project was to create a Chrome extension that would provide real value to users. We brainstormed various ideas and ultimately decided on a tool that enhances the browsing experience by solving a common problem. Converting currencies manually can be inconvenient, time-consuming, and prone to errors. Our Chrome extension solves these issues by providing several key features designed to improve user experience:

1. **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to navigate and use, ensuring a smooth experience for all users.
2. **Seamless Integration**: Fits neatly into the Chrome browser, allowing users to access its functionality without disrupting their browsing.
3. **Real-Time Functionality**: Delivers instant results and updates, providing users with the most current information they need.

We adopted agile methodologies, holding regular meetings to discuss progress and challenges. This approach ensured that everyone was on the same page and could contribute effectively.

## Challenges and Learning
Throughout the project, we inevitably faced some challenges:
- **Technical Hurdles**: Some code worked well in testing but needed adjustments when integrated into the extension.
- **Managing Data**: Storing and managing data across different parts of the extension was more complex than anticipated.
- **API Limitations**: We encountered restrictions on the number of requests we could make to the currency converter API, which also required user authentication.
- **Price Detection**: Detecting and converting prices on web pages had its difficulties, especially with varying formats and larger numbers.
- **Time Management**: Balancing this project with our other academic responsibilities and conflicting schedules was challenging.

Despite these challenges, we learned valuable lessons in teamwork, problem-solving, and software development. Each team member brought unique skills and perspectives, which enriched the project and helped us overcome obstacles.

## Future Plans
We are proud of what we have accomplished, but we also see room for improvement and expansion:
- **Improve UI and UX**: Enhance the user interface and user experience features to make the extension even more intuitive and visually appealing.
- **Additional Features**: We plan to add more features based on user feedback.
- **Optimization**: We aim to optimize the extension for better performance and user experience.
- **Wider Release**: We hope to make our extension available to a broader audience through the Chrome Web Store.

## Conclusion
Working on this Chrome extension was an incredible learning experience for all of us. It taught us the importance of collaboration, effective communication, and perseverance. We are excited to share our work with the world and look forward to hearing your feedback.
